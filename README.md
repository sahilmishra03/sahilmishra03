### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Sahil Mishra**, a Flutter developer based in India.

I design and build mobile apps with clean UI, scalable architecture, and seamless Firebase integrations.

If an app idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Flutter, Dart, Firebase, and Provider.  
My favorite tools are VS Code, Cursor, Postman, and Figma.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is **BullXchange**, a real-time paper trading platform I’m actively working on.

I’ve built many public repos, but privately… it’s probably much more at this point.

If you want to see how I work, my commits will tell you everything.

#### Fun Facts:

* I love playing badminton  
* I don’t drink coffee or tea  
* I enjoy learning UI/UX  
* **Hobbies:** building apps, exploring new tech
